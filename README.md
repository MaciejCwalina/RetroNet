# RetroNet
 
<p>What is RetroNet, RetroNet is a language build by two friends for fun its not meant to solve any problems just more of a learning tool for us to understand how langauges are written and how they work</p>
<p>Here you can see an example of how the language looks its inspired by the good parts of the rust syntax!</p>

```
fn i32 main(){
    i32 x = 10;
    test(x);
}

fn i32 test(i32 a){
    print(a);
}
```
